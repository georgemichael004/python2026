# Python Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice while learning Python fundamentals.

## Topics Covered
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Error handling (try/except)
- Input validation
- Small logic-based programs

## Structure
Each folder represents a day of focused practice with multiple exercises.
Then there are some project based tasks from the freecodecamp.

## Goal
Build strong Python logic before moving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
